what cs - problem solving

shave your though case we are going to program computer
inputs - problems
outputs - solutions

world of computer is 2 digits
zeros and ones

## how computer represent numbers

- binary systems
  - 000 = 0
  - 001 = 1
  - 010 = 2
  - 011 = 3

just only electroic store on don't store power, which is on and off, zero and one to speak

123 = 100 + 20 + 3

which is 10^2 + 10^1 + 10^0

in binary is 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0

## how computer represent letters

one number will represent letters and create global standard
for example 'A' using number '65'

01000001 = 'A'

## how computer distiguish these two

- file formats, JPEG, DOSCX, type of program
- ASCII

bytes = 8 bits

support all human languages, emoji -> Unicode

unicode mapping manymore letters using 16/32 bits -> 4 Billion possibility

## how computer represent color

RGB
combine number of color and show shade of color.

sequence image to create video

format for video is midi

## Algorithm

we implementing algorithm for solving problems

time to solve, size of problem
